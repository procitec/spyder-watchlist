### Added

* Allow selection and removal of multiple entries

* Add “Copy value” action to context menu

### Changed

* Insert new expressions at drop position when text is dropped onto the Watchlist
* Insert new expression at the last position the user clicked when “Add expression” is used (instead of always appending at the end of the list)
* Select the next expression following the removed expression when “Remove expression” is used. Select the previous (= new last) expression if the last expression is removed.
* Don’t sort expressions when they are saved (when the plugin is closed): Retain the order now that it’s possible to rearrange expressions using Drag & Drop.
